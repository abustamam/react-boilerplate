This is the boilerplate from which I will create basic React projects. Intended for use of Free Code Campers, but of course anyone is free to use it.

I created this boilerplate with instructions from the book [SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com). 

Then, I used the latest from Dan Abramov's [React Hot Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/reacthotboilerplate).

## Features

- Github pages deployment
- Sass

## Instructions for use

### Install dependencies:

```		
npm install
```		

### Run the server:

```
npm start
```

### Open the page:
```
localhost:8000
```

Try changing things around in `App.jsx` or `main.sass`

To deploy to github, fork your own, then run:

```
npm run deploy
```

I'm also working on a Redux boilerplate. It's functionally similar to this one, but with Redux and immutable.js
