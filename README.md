This is the boilerplate from which I will create basic React projects. Intended for use of 
Free Code Campers, but of course anyone is free to use it.

Originally forked from Dan Abramov's [React Hot Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)
but used some instructions from the book [SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com) to get it to deploy properly.

## Instructions for use

- Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

- Run the server:

```
npm start
```

- Try changing things around in `app.jsx` or `main.sass`

- To deploy to github, fork your own, then run:

```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
